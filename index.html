                    Akmalinnuha, born and raised in Cirebon Regency. Like most local people, my first language is Cirebon. Since childhood, I often saw my brother playing games and from there I started to love playing games too. 
                    Besides playing games, I love to surf the internet. From the internet, my interest in the world of technology, especially in the IT field, grew. My interest in the IT field is what brings me now to be a student of Informatics Engineering of Filkom UB.

                    IT field is a broad scientific field and i actually interested in some fields. There are 4 fields that i actually really interested, these 4 are Mobile Development, Game Development, Data Science, and Cyber Security.
                    From these four, my deepest interest is for mobile development. I love mobile development field because mobile apps are very helpful for us (humans) both for work and entertainment purposes.
